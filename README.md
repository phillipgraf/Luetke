# Luetke
Luetek is a virtual assistant that provides you with information about the study programs at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology. 
Attention: Luetke only speaks German.

- We developed this assistant for the course "Assistance systems" in my studies in 2021/22.
- We developed it with the Rasa framework (ver. 2.7.1). Unfortunaly we had some problems with rasa and couldnt get the assistant to run completly.
- We developed our own web scraper for the project, as the DIT did not have an API for us at that time. You can find it also in the repository ([ThdAPI](https://github.com/phillipgraf/Luetke/tree/master/ThdAPI)). The web scraper was mostly done by [@Maximilian-v-H](https://github.com/Maximilian-v-H).
